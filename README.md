## [About]
    
![Phishing Intelligence Engine](/images/PIE.png)

The Phishing Intelligence Engine (PIE) is a framework that will assist with the detection and response to phishing attacks. An Active Defense framework built around Office 365, that continuously evaluates Message Trace logs for malicious contents, and dynamically responds as threats are identified or emails are reported.

##### :rotating_light: This framework is not officially supported by LogRhythm - use at your own risk! :rotating_light:

#### Features:

    - Analyze subjects, senders, and recipients using RegEx and Threat Feed correlation, to determine email risk.
    - Automatically respond to attacks by quarantining mail, blocking senders, and checking for clicks.
    - Sandbox analytics on all flagged email attachments and links.
    - Dynamic Case Management integration and metrics tracking.
    - Prevent sensitive data loss and verify corporate email security.
